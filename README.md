# remo-coding-challenge-1

- Clone this repo
- Run `npm install`
- If you are planning to use firebase, create a firebase project and add your config in `src/services/firebase`
- Sample express server is added within this repo. Run `npm run start-server` to start the server in port `8000`.
- This server contains sample get and post request apis and will be accessed in Login page from browser as an example (Component: `Auth.tsx`)
- You are free to use either server and/or firebase for state management
- Run `npm run start` to start the react web server. This will open the landing page with login button

## Requirements

- Use google login/email login to authenticate user
- This app has 2 routes (`/` and `/theater`)
- Convert the route `/theater` as authenticated i.e. user can go into this page only if he/she is logged in
- Theater page

  - This page will have a conference map with tables as below
    ![Map](https://github.com/RiotlySocial/remo-coding-challenge-1/blob/master/Map.png?raw=true)
  - Once user is authenticated, users will be redirected into this theater page
  - Create table DOM elements by accessing `tables` from the `TableConfig`. `first-table` is added as example. `19` tables are present in the configuration
  - Users can go into any table and their avatars will be shown as below.
    ![Map with user avatars](https://github.com/RiotlySocial/remo-coding-challenge-1/blob/master/Map-with%20users.png?raw=true)
  - Assign a table to the user when they land on this page
    - Assignment logic
      - Loom video: https://www.loom.com/share/1b07226e01fe44ca9b9b52899ce8ebb8
      - First user will go into first table, second user will be paired with first user in first table
      - third user will go into second table and fourth will be paired with third user in second table
      - once all the tables have 2 people, next incoming user will go into first table and then second and so on
      - Once all the tables have 3 users, next incoming user will go in first table and then second and so on
      - Users can switch table at any point of time
  - User should be able to switch tables by double clicking on the table
  - If user refreshes the browser at any point of time, they should land on same table
  - At any point of time, one user can be in only one room
  - Max allowed in a table should be configurable ranging from 3 - 6
  - When a table is full and new user tries to enter, show error notification
  - Create a button in the `theater` page. On clicking this button, highlight the currently logged in user avatar with an animation

- Functionality testing (Bonus)
  - How to test this feature in mass scale?
  - This conference map can have 100 people max. How as a developer can you test this with max capacity?
  - You can explain this in loom video, if you dont have time to implement.

## Deliverables

- Zip file containing the codebase (except node_modules)
- Create a loom video with:
  - demo of the application
  - Challenges you have faced and how you solved it
  - How can you improve your code
  - Comments on this test
